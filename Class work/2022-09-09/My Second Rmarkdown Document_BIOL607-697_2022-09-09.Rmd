# You can write a header

## Second level header

### Third level header

#### Fourth level header

You can write text *Italic text with one asterisk*\
**Bold text with two asterisks**

Enter two spaces after a line for a line break

```{r first_chunk}

# Enter ```{r} to write a code cunk
# Everything here will be executed as code

data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)

```

Summary output of {r first_chunk}

```{r second_chunk, echo = FALSE}

summary(mtcars)

```

Do something, but leave no trace...

```{r third_chink, include = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# include = FALSE means this will not appear in the visual/output
# warnings = FALSE means this will not induce print warning messages
# message = FALSe means this will not induce diagnositic messages from the arguments

str(mtcars)
min(mtcars)
max(mtcars)

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
