# Part 1:

## Part 1z: Load data and review

```{r part_1z}
brainlang <- read.csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter16/chap16q15LanguageGreyMatter.csv")
str(brainlang)
summary(brainlang)
# vars are proficiency (treatment) and grey matter (outcome)
```

## Part 1a: Display association between the two vars in scatter plot

```{r part_1a}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
brainlang_basicviz <- ggplot(data = brainlang,
                             mapping = aes(x = proficiency,
                                           y = greymatter)) +
  geom_point()
brainlang_basicviz

# Adding a more advanced plot that includes R2 value and pearson correlation

brainlang_advancedviz <- ggscatter(brainlang,
                                   x = "proficiency",
                                   y = "greymatter",
                                   add = "reg.line",
                                   conf.int = TRUE,
                                   cor.coef = TRUE,
                                   cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(title = "Does learning a second language change brain structure?",
       subtitle = "Comparing second language proficiency on grey matter volume",
       x = "Second language proficiency rating",
       y = "Grey matter volume")
brainlang_advancedviz
```

## Part 1b: Calculate the correlation between second language proficiency and gray-matter density

```{r part_1b}
cor(brainlang$greymatter,
    brainlang$proficiency)
```

## Part 1c: SKIP

## Part 1d: What are the assumptions when testing the null hypothesis of zero correlation?

```{r part_1d}
library(performance)

brainlang_lm <- lm(greymatter ~ proficiency,
               data = brainlang)

check_model(brainlang_lm)

# Posterior Predictive Check - simulated data compared to the observed data
# Linearity - observation depends on the treatment/condition
# Homogeneity of variance - variances of two or more samples are considered equal
# Independence of errors / Influential Observations - there is no relationship between the errors and the observations
# Normality (of residuals) - treatment follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution
```

## Part 1e: Does the scatter plot support these assumptions? Explain

```{r part_1e}
# Predictions check
check_predictions(brainlang_lm,
                  iterations = 100)
# Predicted lines do not closely fit the observed data

# Linearity check
library(modelr)

brainlang <- brainlang |>
  add_predictions(brainlang_lm) |>
  add_residuals(brainlang_lm)

ggplot(brainlang,
       mapping = aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth()
# The reference line is not flat / horizontal - data appears non-linear

# Alternative plotting method:
# check_model(brainlang_lm, check = "ncv") %>% 
  # plot()

# Homogeneity:
check_heteroscedasticity(brainlang_lm) |>
  plot()
# again, data appears non-linear

# Normality:
check_normality(brainlang_lm) %>% 
  plot()
# Distribution is close-ish but not that close to the normal curve

# Alternative plotting method:
# check_normality(brainlang_lm) %>% 
# plot(type = "qq")

# Outliers:
plot(brainlang_lm, which = 4)
# distance is larger than previous examples we have covered

check_outliers(brainlang_lm) %>% 
  plot()
# All points are within the contour lines though
```

## Part 1f: Do the results demonstrate that second language proficiency affects gray matter density in the brain? Why or why not?

### Notes:
    1. Looking at the plots in 1a, the general trend is that as second language profic. increases, grey matter volume increases.
    2. I'll check the R2 value to see how closely the independent variable is related to the dependent variable

```{r part_1f}
model_performance(brainlang_lm)
```
### Notes:
    1. R2 value = 0.67. Somewhat strong correlation suggesting that language proficiency does increase grey matter

# Part 2:

## Part 2z: Load data and review

```{r part_2z}
grass <- read.csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter17/chap17q19GrasslandNutrientsPlantSpecies.csv")

str(grass)
summary(grass)
```

## Part 2a: Scatter plot the data

```{part_2a}
library(ggplot2)

grass_basicviz <- ggplot(data = grass,
                             mapping = aes(x = nutrients,
                                           y = species)) +
  geom_point()
grass_basicviz
```

## Part 2b: What is the rate of change in # plant species supported by nutrient type added?

```{r part_2b}
# Create model
grass_lm <- lm(species ~ nutrients,
                   data = grass)

# Check it's fit
check_model(grass_lm)

# Check the estimate (rate of change) of the fitted line
library(broom)
tidy(grass_lm) # estimate = -3.34
```

## Part 2c: Add the least-squared regression line to the scatter plot

```{r part_2c}
library(ggpmisc)

grass_fit_plot <- ggplot(data = grass_lm,
                         mapping = aes(x = nutrients,
      y = species)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(after_stat(eq.label),
                                 after_stat(rr.label), sep = "*\", \"*"))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ x)
grass_fit_plot
```
### R2 = 0.54

## Part 2d: Test the null hypothesis on no treatment effect on the number of plant species

### Notes:
    1. treatment = nutrients = x
    2. outcome = species = y
    3. Math:
        a. f(x) = 34.1 - 3.34x
        b. f(0) = 34.1

# Part 3:

## Part 3z: Load data and review

```{r part_3z}
beetle <- read.csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter17/chap17q25BeetleWingsAndHorns.csv")

str(beetle)
summary(beetle)

beetle_basicviz <- ggplot(data = beetle,
                         mapping = aes(x = hornSize,
                                       y = wingMass)) +
  geom_point()
beetle_basicviz
```

## Part 3a: calculate the residuals

```{r part_3a}
beetle_lm <- lm(wingMass ~ hornSize,
                 data = beetle)
beetle_lm
summary(beetle_lm)
```

## Part 3b: Produce a residual plot

```{r part_3b}
beetle <- beetle %>% 
  add_predictions(beetle_lm) %>% 
  add_residuals(beetle_lm)

beetle_residual_plot <- ggplot(data = beetle,
                               mapping = aes(x = pred,
                                             y = resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth()
beetle_residual_plot
```

## Part 3c: evaluate main assumptions of linear regression (using provided plot & resid plot)

```{r part_3c}
check_model(beetle_lm)

# linearity and homogeneity of variance look weird, PPC maybe looks weird

# looking at homogeneity of variance closer
check_heteroskedasticity(beetle_lm) %>% 
  plot()
# looking at linearity closer
check_model(beetle_lm, check = "ncv") %>% 
  plot()
# this could be non-linearity
```

## Part 3d: What steps should be taken?

### Notes:
    1. Transformation for non-linearity by log transformation

## Part 3e: Do any other diagnostics seem weird?

```{r part_3e}
check_normality(beetle_lm) %>% 
  plot()
# distribution does not really fit the normal curve too closely

plot(beetle_lm, which = 4)
check_outliers(beetle_lm) %>% 
  plot(type = "bar")
check_outliers(beetle_lm) %>% 
  plot()
# there are a few data points (1, 6, 19) that are on the cusp of breaking the contour lines
```

# Part 4:

## Part 4z: load data and review

```{r part_4z}
teeth <- read.csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter17/chap17q30NuclearTeeth.csv")

str(teeth)
summary(teeth)

teeth_basicviz <- ggplot(data = teeth,
                          mapping = aes(x = deltaC14,
                                        y = dateOfBirth)) +
  geom_point()
teeth_basicviz
```

## Part 4a: what is the slope of the regression line?

```{r part_4a}
teeth_lm <- lm(dateOfBirth ~ deltaC14,
               data = teeth)

teeth_fit_plot <- ggplot(data = teeth_lm,
                         mapping = aes(x = deltaC14,
                                       y = dateOfBirth)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(after_stat(eq.label),
                                 after_stat(rr.label), sep = "*\", \"*"))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ x)
teeth_fit_plot
# slope `is -0.0533
```

## Part 4b: Which pair of lines shows the confidence bands? What do they tell us?

### Notes:
    1. The inner pair of dotted lines show confidence bands
    2. These indicate the range that the population parameter is likely to fall within

## Part 4c: Which pair of lines shows the prediction interval? What do they tell us?

### Notes:
    1. The outer pair of dotted lines show the prediction interval
    2. These indicate the range that likely contains a new value for a dependent variable given a new observation

### Part 4d: Use augment() and geom_ribbon() to reproduce the above plot with data, fit, fit interval, and prediction interval

```{r part_4d}
teeth_model_log <- lm(log(dateOfBirth) ~ deltaC14,
                      data = teeth)

x_frame <- teeth %>% 
  data_grid(deltaC14 = seq_range(deltaC14, n = 100))

teeth_log_curve <- data_grid(teeth,
                             deltaC14 = seq_range(deltaC14, n = 100)) %>% 
  augment(x = teeth_model_log,
          data = .x,
          interval = "confidence") %>% 
  mutate(across(c(.fitted:.upper),
                .fns = exp))
teeth_log_curve

teeth_pred <- augment(x = teeth_lm,
                      newdata = x_frame,
                      interval = "prediction")
teeth_pred

teeth_conf_pred_plot <- teeth_basicviz + 
  geom_line(data = teeth_log_curve,
            mapping = aes(y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = teeth_log_curve,
              mapping = aes(y = .fitted,
                            ymin = .lower,
                            ymax  =.upper),
              alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line(data = teeth_pred,
            mapping = aes(y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = teeth_pred,
              mapping = aes(y = .fitted,
                            ymin = .lower,
                            ymax  =.upper),
              alpha = 0.2)
teeth_conf_pred_plot
```

# Part 5: Impress Yourself

## Part 5a: Fit the deets and bite model from last lab

```{r part_5a}
mosquito <- read.csv("/Users/nathanstrozewski/Documents/Everything/Education/M.S. Biology UMB/Courses/003_F2022/Biological Data Analysis/Homework/Homework #5/Data/17q24DEETMosquiteBites.csv")

mosquito_model <- lm(bites ~ dose,
                     data = mosquito)

## Look at vcov()

vcov(mosquito_model)

## Look at mnormt()

library(mnormt)
rmnorm(4, mean = coef(mosquito_model), varcov = vcov(mosquito_model))
```

## Part 5b: Fit simulations

### Notes:
    1. Using geom_abline(), make a plot that has the following layers:
        a. the data
        b. the lm fit with a CI, and
        c. simulated lines

```{r part_5b}

mosquito_plot <- ggplot(data = mosquito,
                        mapping = aes(x = dose,
                                      y = bites)) +
  geom_point()
mosquito_plot

mosquito_model_log <- lm(log(bites) ~ dose, data = mosquito)
mosquito_log_curve <- data_grid(mosquito,
                                dose = seq_range(dose, n = 100)) %>% 
  augment(x = mosquito_model_log,
          data = .x,
          interval = "confidence") %>% 
  mutate(across(c(.fitted:.upper),
                .fns = exp))
mosquito_log_curve

mosquito_sims <- data.frame(rmnorm(100, mean = coef(mosquito_model), varcov = vcov(mosquito_model)))
mosquito_sims

mosquito_plot_5b <- mosquito_plot + 
  geom_line(data = mosquito_log_curve,
            mapping = aes(y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mosquito_log_curve,
              mapping = aes(y = .fitted,
                            ymin = .lower,
                            ymax  =.upper),
              alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = mosquito_sims$dose,
              intercept = mosquito_sims$X.Intercept)
mosquito_plot_5b
```

## Part 5c: Add prediction intervals for simulated lines

```{r part_5c}
summary(mosquito_model_log)

mosquito_predictions <- data.frame(predict(mosquito_model_log, newdata = mosquito_sims, interval = "predict"))
mosquito_predictions 

library(dplyr)
mosquito_predictions_withbounds <- cbind(mosquito_sims, mosquito_predictions)
mosquito_predictions_withbounds

mosquito_predictions_final <- data.frame(mosquito_predictions_withbounds) %>% 
  mutate(X.Intercept_lwr = X.Intercept. - lwr) %>% 
  mutate(X.Intercept_upr = X.Intercept. + upr)
mosquito_predictions_final

mosquito_plot_5c <- mosquito_plot + 
  geom_line(data = mosquito_log_curve,
            mapping = aes(y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mosquito_log_curve,
              mapping = aes(y = .fitted,
                            ymin = .lower,
                            ymax  =.upper),
              alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = mosquito_sims$dose,
              intercept = mosquito_sims$X.Intercept) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mosquito_predictions_final,
              mapping = aes(y = X.Intercept.,
                            ymin = X.Intercept_lwr,
                            ymax = X.Intercept_upr))
mosquito_plot_5c
```
### Notes:
    1. I can't figure out how to get the ribbon around the geom_abline values
    2. Close-ish, maybe! I gave it my best shot


# Part 6: Meta Questions

## Meta 1: How well do you feel you understand the assumption testing behind a linear model? If there are elements that confuse you, what are they? Why?

### Notes:
    1. I feel somewhat confident about assumption testing now
    2. When we first covered it in lecture, I didn't understand what the assumptions were or how they fit into statistical analysis
    3. After additional reading and practice, I get why we look at them and how they help
    4. I am still a little confused on 

## Meta 2: What concepts of linear regression are the clearest for you? Which are the most opaque?

### Notes:
    1. Outliers makes the most sense - very straightforward
    2. The positive predictor check is really cool and makes sense
    3. I don't fully get homogeneity of variance, but I am getting there

## Meta 3: Even if you did not do the IYKYK part of this assignment do you see how simulation can be used with a fit model? Do you feel it would be useful? Do you have gaps in your understanding about why simulation could work here?

### Notes:
    1. I attempted IYb and could not get the ribbon of predicted bounds around my geom_abline
    2. But going through IYa and some of IYb was helpful to understand HOW we can use simulation with a fit model
    3. This would absolutely be useful - I really want to figure out how to finish this so that I can see
    4. No conceptual gaps yet - just technical (code) gaps

## Meta 4: How much time did this take you, roughly? 

### Notes:
    1. This took me approximately two hours

## Meta 5: Please give yourself a weak/sufficient/strong assessment on this assignment

### Notes:
    1. I would rate myself between sufficient and strong - maybe closer to strong
    2. I feel that I understand the concepts covered (mostly)
    3. I was able to complete all of the problems, except IYb which I got close-ish on
    4. I am definitely getting better at applying my knowledge and problem solving within R
